## INNER LOOP (Prototype)
Habits → Focus → Reflection → Growth

A minimalist habit-tracking dashboard built to experiment with React state, Tailwind CSS dark mode, and Uiverse component integration.

### Current Status: WIP
This is currently a static prototype. I am using this to test:

- Dynamic theme switching (Dark/Light).
- Glassmorphism UI layouts.
- Custom CSS animations for buttons and navigation.

#### How to View the Project
To see the dashboard in action on your local machine:

Clone & Enter:
```bash
git clone [your-link-here]
cd inner-loop
```
Install:
```bash
npm install
```
Run:
```bash
npm run dev
```
Open: Click the local link in your terminal (usually http://localhost:5173) to view the app in your browser.

### Tech Used
React (Vite)

Tailwind CSS (Theming)

Uiverse.io (UI Components)

### Future Roadmap
1. Add "Add Habit" functionality.
2. Connect to LocalStorage to save progress.
3. Implement a Pomodoro focus timer.
